      "Set the oven to broiler and place the muffin inside in the heat until toasted. Remove them and set aside. In the meantime, heat a pan on medium-high heat and add bacon slices. If they stick to the pan, you should try adding a little olive oil and frying it until crispy. When done, layer the toasted muffins with bacon.",
      "To poach the eggs, fill half a pan with water. Let the water simmer over medium-low heat, making sure it doesn’t boil. Crack one egg into a bowl keeping the yolk intact. Gently slide it into the simmering water and do the same with the other eggs. When the egg white is set but the yolk is still water, remove from water with a slotted spoon and place them on top of the bacon.",
      "Drizzle the Hollandaise sauce over the egg muffin and serve. This is the simplest method to learn how to make eggs Benedict. With experience and time, you can make your own Hollandaise sauce recipe and experiment with other seasonings. Serve and enjoy."
